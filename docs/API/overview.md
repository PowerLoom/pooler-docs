# Pooler API Overview and Endpoints

## Overview

The Pooler API endpoints documented on the sidepane are connector APIs that adapt the low level APIs opened up by Audit Protocol. The connectors ensure that the low level details are hidden from developers interested in datapoints and logic specific to Uniswap v2. They have been [opened up on hosted instances](#hosted-api) of Pooler that snapshot different DeFi protocol data that are compatible with Uniswap v2 AMM architecture:
* Uniswap v2(Ethereum mainnet)
* SushiSwap(Etherum mainnet)
* QuickSwap (Polygon mainnet)

This is *exclusively* setup for [ETH India 2022](https://www.notion.so/Powerloom-Protocol-EthIndia-2022-9dabaa6bf419406889f943ac90276c33).

All the API endpoints are available for the given protocols.

```
ðŸ’¡ While the endpoints allow nominal usage for public access without an API key, we **do not** recommend them for developers. Doing so can severely restrict access to your IP address.
```
